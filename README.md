# Keep - A Google Keep Clone
I personally use Google Keep alot for day to day note taking so I decided to make a mini-clone of it.

Technologies used:
- django
- django-rest-framework
- react

Skills learned:
- Connecting frontend and backend together
- Creating api using django and django-rest-framework
- Consuming api using react and axios
- Deploying react app to gh-pages and api to heroku

Here's the [link](http://github.stuartelimu.me/keep/) to the working application.
